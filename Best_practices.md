1. Never deploy anything you haven’t personally tested.
2. Validate all AI responses for correctness and safety.
3. Always log inputs, outputs, and timestamps for traceability.
4. Keep your prompts and configurations under version control.
5. Track every API call, monitor quotas, usage, and latency.
6. Plan for outages, design fallback workflows for API failures.
7. Cache frequent queries, save money and reduce API calls.
8. Set clear timeout limits on external service requests.
9. Never assume the model “just works”, expect failure modes.
10. Review every line of code that interacts with the AI.
11. Sanitize all data before it hits your models.
12. Never save unverified model outputs to your database.
13. Monitor system health with real-time dashboards.
14. Keep secrets (API keys, tokens) away from your codebase.
15. Automate unit, integration, and regression tests for your stack.
16. Retest and redeploy models on a regular cadence.
17. Document every integration detail and model limitation.
18. Never ship features you can’t explain to your users.
19. Use JSON or structured data for model outputs, avoid raw text.
20. Benchmark latency and throughput under load.
21. Alert on anomalies, not just outright failures.
22. Test model outputs against adversarial, nonsensical, and edge-case inputs.
23. Track cost-per-query, and know where spikes come from.
24. Build feature flags to roll back risky changes instantly.
25. Maintain a “kill switch” to quickly disable AI features if needed.
26. Keep error logs detailed and human-readable.
27. Limit user exposure to raw or unmoderated model responses.
28. Rotate credentials and secrets on a fixed schedule.
29. Record and audit all changes in prompts, models, and data sources.
30. Schedule regular model evaluations for drift and performance drops.
31. Implement access controls for sensitive data and models.
32. Track and limit PII (personally identifiable information) everywhere.
33. Share postmortems and edge cases with your team, learn from mistakes.
34. Set budget alerts to catch runaway costs early.
35. Isolate test, staging, and production environments.
