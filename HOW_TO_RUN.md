# How to Run the Intelligent Recruiter Search System

## 🎯 Complete System Overview

You now have a production-ready intelligent candidate search system with:

1. **Backend API** (FastAPI) - Natural language search with multi-vector fusion
2. **Frontend UI** (Streamlit) - Beautiful recruiter dashboard
3. **Vector Database** (Qdrant Cloud) - 4,889 candidates with 3 embeddings each
4. **AI Parser** (Gemini) - Automatic filter extraction from natural language

## 🚀 Quick Start (Easiest Method)

### Option 1: Use the Launcher Script

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/prita/Downloads/SuperLinked
./start_ui.sh
```

This automatically:
- Checks if FastAPI is running (starts it if not)
- Launches the Streamlit UI
- Opens your browser to http://localhost:8501

## 📝 Manual Start (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Start FastAPI Backend

**Terminal 1:**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/prita/Downloads/SuperLinked
python3 scripts/api/search_api.py
```

You should see:
```

```

API Endpoints:
- http://localhost:8000 - Root
- http://localhost:8000/docs - Interactive API docs
- http://localhost:8000/health - Health check
- http://localhost:8000/search - Search endpoint

### Step 2: Start Streamlit UI

**Terminal 2:**
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/prita/Downloads/SuperLinked

```

You should see:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.
